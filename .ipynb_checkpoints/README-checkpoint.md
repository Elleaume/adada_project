# Abstract

Since September 11 2001, terrorism has been in the headlines around the globe. A general fear reappears every few years as events labeled as "terrorist attacks" occur. Certain parties have gained in popularity in the past few years, often using the anxiety of "dangerous terrorists" as a pretext to defend anti-immigrant policies. Have terrorist attacks increased in the past years as we are lead to believe? or has the rate been more or less constant? Are foreigners or immigrants really more likely to commit these terrorist attacks? News coverage plays a big role in how we percieve these events, some events are debated and discussed during weeks, while others are never mentioned. We want to explore the rate and distribution of these attacks over the world, and dive into their news coverage in the western hemisphere.  

# Research questions

- Have the terrorist attack rates, motives, locations, changed over the past 50 years?
- Where do terrorist attacks occur?
- Who commit terrorist attacks and by what motive?
- What is the general news coverage and therefore biased opinion concerning these attacks? and how is this linked with the immigration question?

# Dataset

and 
All the news: a database of news coverage from CNN, New york times, Breitbart, Fox news, the Gardian, to name a few. Articles span from 2015 to 2017. We are hoping to extract information concerning news coverage of terrorist attacks as well as information concerning immigrantion policies.
