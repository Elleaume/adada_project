Since September 11 2001, terrorism has been in the headlines around the globe. A general fear reappears every few years as events labeled as "terrorist attacks" occur. Certain parties have gained in popularity in the past few years, often using the anxiety of "dangerous terrorists" as a pretext to defend anti-immigrant policies. Have terrorist attacks increased in the past years as we are lead to believe? or has the rate been more or less constant? Are foreigners or immigrants really more likely to commit these terrorist attacks? News coverage plays a big role in how we perceive these events, some events are debated and discussed during weeks, while others are never mentioned. We want to explore the rate and distribution of these attacks over the world, and dive into their news coverage in the western hemisphere.

  <h4>Number of terrorist attacks across years</h4>
  {% include CountAttacks.html %}
  <p>Looking over the years from 1970 to 2017, we can see an increase of incidents, especially in recent years starting around 2010.
There is a strange gap in the data in 1993. Looking into terror attacks in 1993, we can clearly see that it is not that no attacks happened during this year (ex, attack on worldtrade center on February 23 1993 https://www.state.gov/1993-world-trade-center-bombing/) Reading into the information on the dataset, we found that the data was lost prior to addition to the dataset. This explanes the gap observed.
