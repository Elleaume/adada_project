# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

In the light of the recent events, our carbon emissions have become a hot topic. It is often difficult to understand how our food choices, composed by many components from around the world, have an effect on our general carbon footprint. We will go try to extract recent food trends and expose their environmental impacts. We will investigate the different macroelements composing our daily diets, and go into the tradeoff between health impact and their environmental implications. We will exploit the Open Food Facts data base, as well as the publication "Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers" (Science, 360(6392), 987-992). We want to observe consumer differences between the United states, and France as they represent the largest amount of data in our data set. 

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 
- What are the general food trends? Are there large differences between France and the USA?
- Can a hypothetical carbon foot print be attributed to the different food items?
- What food trends have the biggest carbon footprint? How important is the transport between production and place of consomation?
- Grade declarations describe the health impact of food items. What is the most optimal balance or trade-off between impact on the environment and on our health?


# Dataset

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

Open food facts: https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data
and 
"Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers" (Science, 360(6392), 987-992)

The open food database is created by consumers for consumers. People scan and enter descriptions and general information about a product. Being modified by many users, there is a large amount of data cleaning needed. 
Open Food facts is composed of around 10^6 entries, about 60% of which are from french products, and about 18% corresponding to products consumed in the USA. Some general information concerning the entries are: country of origin and manufacture, the food categories, the food components, date and number of modifications, scale of health impact (from A to E), palm oil contained, some carbon footprint information, packaging, brands and allergens. 


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

clean data set (1-2weeks)
extract general trends (1 week)
comparison USA france (1 week)
put in relation with environmental impact data set (1 week)
explore carbon foot print impact of different components (1 week)



# Questions for TAa
Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.

Is our approach too mainstream? 
Should we also link with recipes?
Can columns with similar titles be merged?
Issues in dataset for cleaning: many languages, repetitions, many types of tags, what is the best approach?
